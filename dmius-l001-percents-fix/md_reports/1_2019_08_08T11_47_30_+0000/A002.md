## Conclusions ##
  - All nodes have the same Postgres version (`11.4`).  

  - Postgres major version being used is `11` and it is currently supported by PostgreSQL Global Development Group. End of life is scheduled 2023-11-09. It means that in case of bugs and security issues, updates (new minor versions) with fixes will be released and available for use. Read more: [Versioning Policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).  

  - [P2] The minor version being used (`11.4`) is not up-to-date (the newest version: `11.5`). See [the full list of changes between 11.4 and 11.5](https://why-upgrade.depesz.com/show?from=11.4&to=11.5).
