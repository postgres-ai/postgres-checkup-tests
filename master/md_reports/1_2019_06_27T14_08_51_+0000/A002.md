## Conclusions ##
  - All nodes have the same Postgres version (`11.4`).  

  - Postgres major version being used is `11` and it is currently supported by Postgres community and PGDG (end of life is scheduled 2023-11-09). It means that in case of bugs and security issues, updates (new minor versions) with fixes will be released and available for use. Read more: [Versioning Policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).  

  - `11.4` is the most up-to-date Postgres minor version in the branch `11`.
