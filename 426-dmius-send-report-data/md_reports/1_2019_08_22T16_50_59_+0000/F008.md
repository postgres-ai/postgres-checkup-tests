## Conclusions ##
  - [P1] Autovacuum cost delay and limit are not tuned. In Postgres versions prior to version 12, the effective values of `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` and `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` are too conservative, so autovacuum is overly throttled. Roughly speaking, the default settings mean, that all autovacuum workers (except which currently processing tables with individual, per-table settings) can read data with combined read throughput only up to ~8 MiB/s. This is extremely low for modern disk systems, and with growing sizes of tables and indexes it might lead to cases when some objects are processed by autovacuum during many hours: for example, it will take ~30 hours to read 1 TiB of data if the allowed throughput is just 8 MiB/s. In some cases, it might lead to serious issues such as performance degradation due to inability to process big tables in timed fashion and growing bloat, and even to such critical issues as transaction ID wraparound. At the same time, if disk system is powerful enough these risks can be easily mitigated by reducing throttling for autovacuum. In Postgres 12, it was decided to decrease `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` 10 times (from 20 ms to 2 ms).
  
 


## Recommendations ##
  - [P1] Autovacuum cost delay and limit are not tuned. Consider raising `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` or decreasing `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay`: for example, consider decreasing `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` to 2 milliseconds, as it was done in default  values in Postgres 12. For more fine-grained tuning, analyze disk capabilities (first of all, random read and random write troughput) and observe logs with `log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0`, and perform several iterations of tuning.
