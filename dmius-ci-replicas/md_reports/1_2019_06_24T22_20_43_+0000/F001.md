## Conclusions ##
  - [P1] Autovacuum is not tuned. The following parameters are default, meaning that autovacuum behavior is far from optimal for an OLTP workload leading to higher levels of bloat in tables and indexes, lagging statistics:  
    - `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` = 0.2 and `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold` = 50  
    - `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` = 0.1 and `autovacuum_analyze_threshold` = 50  
    - `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` = 20 and `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` = -1  
  

  
 


## Recommendations ##
  - [P1] Autovacuum is not tuned. Consider its tuning for your workload.
